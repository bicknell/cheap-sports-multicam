This page documents quirks about cameras that may affact the video output.

## Akaso Brave 7 LE

1. When the camera rolls over to a new file sometimes the 3rd frame is repeated
   twice.  Firmware 1.3.D\_T, reported to Akaso support 2025-08-30.

   Workaround: Akaso recommends enabling "Loop Mode".  Initial testing with
   loop mode enabled and set to 5 minute roll over almost entirely eliminates
   the problem.  About 1 file in 40 still has one extra frame, which is much
   better.

1. When the camera rolls over to a new file sometimes ~15 frames are dropped.
   This appears to happen approximately 1 in 8 files.  Firmware 1.3.D\_T.

   Workaround: Akaso recommends enabling "Loop Mode".  Testing is underway.
