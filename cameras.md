# Cameras

No action camera is perfect, this document attempts to document the pros and
cons, and known issues with various models to help you make an informed 
decision.  If you use a different camera, please provide feedback
to be added to this page.

## Akaso Brave 7 LE

Pro:
   - Inexpensive, can usually be found on sale for around $120 or bundled with
     an SD card for a few dollars more.
   - Can sync wall clock time via the app.
   - Camera is rated to be water-resistant without the plastic underwater case,
     which allows it to be used in light rain without a case.  This in turn allows
     the microphone to remain functional.

Neutral:
   - Default image is overexposed, but setting EV to -1.0 largely fixes the issue.
   - Factory batteries seem to last about 2 hours.

Con:
   - Microphone faces to the left which often has it pointing in a non-useful direction.
   - Microphone is low quality.

Known Bugs/Quirks:
   - When the camera rolls over to a new file sometimes the 3rd frame is repeated
     twice.  Firmware 1.3.D\_T, reported to Akaso support 2025-08-30.
   - When the camera rolls over to a new file sometimes ~15 frames are dropped.
     Firmware 1.3.D\_T, reported to Akaso support 2025-09-03.

**WARNING:** Akaso has sold two very different cameras under the same name of 
"Akaso Brave 7 LE", and externally they look identical.  The newer model has vastly 
internals and software.  All my instructions are for the newer model, running
Firmware 1.3, and listed as manual "580+386\_V1.0" on Akaso's web site.

Purchase:
   - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AKASO-Brave-4K30FPS-Underwater-Batteries/dp/B08B3MFDQL/),
     as of 2025-09-06 the price is $139 with a 20% off coupon making the price $111.  Also look for bundles with 64G/128G/256G memory cards.

## GoPro

The GoPro Hero 12 and Hero 13 support a [time code sync](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/HERO12-Black-Timecode-Sync) option.  This may aid in automatically aligning the video in post-processing.
